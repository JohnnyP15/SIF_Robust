# 📷 Computer Vision Tools for Camera Calibration, Image Augmentation & Matching

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts developed for various computer vision tasks using OpenCV and other tools. These utilities are designed to assist with:

* Real-time camera control and calibration
* Robust feature-based image matching using RANSAC and SIFT
* Advanced image augmentation to simulate lighting conditions, blur, and perspective
* Image undistortion using calibration parameters

## 🔧 Tools Included

### 1. `gui_camera.py`

A Tkinter-based GUI for capturing images from a webcam with customizable camera settings. Features include:

* Adjustable sliders for brightness, contrast, focus, exposure, and more
* Live grayscale toggle
* Automatic saving of settings and images for calibration

### 2. `unidistort_image.py`

Loads an image and applies undistortion using precomputed calibration data.

* Useful for correcting lens distortion after camera calibration
* Visual comparison between original and corrected image

### 3. `ransac_v4.py`

Performs robust template matching using:

* SIFT feature detection
* BFMatcher with Lowe’s ratio test
* Homography estimation via RANSAC
* Visual feedback on keypoints, matches, and the detected template region

### 4. `augmentation.py`

Generates synthetic variations of images using `albumentations`. Simulates:

* Lighting and shadow conditions
* Camera effects like defocus, motion blur, and compression
* Geometric distortions and perspective changes

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure to install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib albumentations pillow
```

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
📂 calibration_images        # Captured images from the GUI
📂 imagenes_originales       # Input images for augmentation
📂 imagenes_aumentadas       # Output images with synthetic variations
📄 settings.csv              # Camera settings log (generated by GUI)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Capture Images for Calibration:**

   ```bash
   python gui_camera.py
   ```

2. **Undistort Images with Calibration Data:**

   ```bash
   python unidistort_image.py
   ```

3. **Run Template Matching with RANSAC:**

   ```bash
   python ransac_v4.py
   ```

4. **Apply Image Augmentation:**

   ```bash
   python augmentation.py
   ```
